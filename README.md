# Analysis of M51-galaxy
To prove the hypothesis that the M51 Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a bright nucleus with help of image processing technologies along with the EDA of the M51 galaxy.

# Introduction
Research in astronomy is making rapidly increasing use of analysis methods that draw from developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning.
In this Assignment I have used Data science and Image processing tools (like filters and feature extraction techniques) with python on the data set of Galaxy M51.
The M51 galaxy, a classic spiral galaxy, also known as whirlpool galaxy. Discovered by Charles Messier in 1773, M51 is located 31 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. It has an apparent magnitude of 8.4 and can be spotted with a small telescope most easily during May. The Whirlpool galaxy’s beautiful face-on view and closeness to Earth allow astronomers to study a classic spiral galaxy’s structure and star-forming processes.M51, also known as NGC 5194, is one of the brightest and most picturesque galaxies on the sky. Astronomers speculate that M51's spiral structure is primarily due to its gravitational interaction with a smaller galaxy. These arms serve an important purpose: they are star-formation factories, compressing hydrogen gas and creating clusters of new stars.

# Inference

Through this project I was trying to prove spiral structure of M51 galaxy with bright nucleus. For that used data science and python. Several image processing libraries and modules also included. Filtered the data available in GALAXIES_CENTER.zip as fits.
Using Meijering and sato filter along with shape index feature depicted the spiral structure of M51 galaxy. in various colour map the result was almost same. Spiral arms of the M51 was clear and the nucleus part was very bright. This due to active nature of nucleus.

Astronomical data science is fast growing among researches. Because the nature of data , ML and deep learning are more suitable in analyzing the astronomical data set. Fits is the format used to store the data. Through this work with help several image processing tools able to reach in a conclusion that M51 Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with active nucleus. And the spiral arms are formed by stars of different generation and dust and gases.
